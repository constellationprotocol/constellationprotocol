# Constellation Protocol
Constellation seeks to simplify and structure the future.

This unlocks countless yield and alpha opportunities by delivering TradFi strategies once reserved for ultra-high net worth individuals to the DeFi masses.

At its core, Constellation brings together the best in DeFi composability, taking advantage of the interoperability of various protocols to offer dependable returns with prudent levels of risk.

This builds upon tested and proven strategies in the TradFi world, now unleashed on- chain with the flexibility and freedom of DeFi. Our first port of call will be the Terra network with its blossoming ecosystem, taking advantage of existing and upcoming protocols such as Mirror, Anchor, Prism, Sigma, Mars, Levana and Ozone.

As more protocols are launched, we will seek to integrate with each one of them in innovative ways, with the goal of delivering well-defined payoffs within controlled levels of risk.

Think of us as your personal private banker.
